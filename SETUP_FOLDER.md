# 🎯 Quick Setup: Add Base Folder

## ✅ You're Signed In!

Great! You're signed in to Google Drive. Now you need to set your base folder.

## 📍 Two Ways to Set Folder:

### Option 1: Enter Folder ID (Recommended - Works Immediately)

1. **In the Settings modal, click:** "Set Folder ID" button (grey button)

2. **Get your Folder ID:**
   - Go to https://drive.google.com
   - Create or open a folder (e.g., "Mail Reports")
   - Open the folder (double-click)
   - Look at the URL:
     ```
     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j
     ```
   - The **Folder ID** is the part after `/folders/`
   - Copy this ID (just the ID, not the full URL)

3. **Paste in the app:**
   - When prompted "Enter Google Drive Folder ID:", paste the ID
   - When prompted "Enter folder name:", type "Mail Reports" (or any name)
   - Click OK

✅ **Done!** Your folder is now set up.

### Option 2: Use Folder Picker (If Working)

2. **A folder picker will open**
   - Select your folder
   - Click "Select"

3. **Folder will be set automatically**

**Note:** If you see "Google Picker API not loaded", use Option 1 instead.
