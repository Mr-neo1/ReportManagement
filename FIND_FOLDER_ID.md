# 📁 How to Find Google Drive Folder ID

## Method 1: Using Google Drive URL (Easiest)

### Steps:

1. **Go to Google Drive:** https://drive.google.com

2. **Create or navigate to your folder:**
   - Create a new folder (e.g., "Mail Reports")
   - OR open an existing folder you want to use

3. **Open the folder** (double-click to open it)

4. **Look at the URL in your browser:**
   - The URL will look like:
     ```
     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j
     ```
   - The **Folder ID** is the part after `/folders/`
   - In this example: `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`

5. **Copy the Folder ID** (the long string of letters and numbers)
